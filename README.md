## Course Project for Week 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis course on Coursera

Please check project description in original GitHub repository - [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

The task was to get data on "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a> and chart data for two days in February in a prescribed ways. The goal was to reproduce target charts in the "figure" folder.

In order for scripts to work the data file <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> should be downloaded and unzipped to the working directory.

I couldn't reproduce colors though, as it's hard to read them on lines that thin, and I'm also partially colorblind.
I also disliked replicating data reading part in four separate files, but this was the task - to submit four files of scripts and four files of charts they produce.
